### Simplicity

^^The language MUST be simple^^. To that end, each feature the language gets must be painstakingly researched and considered to see how it fits into the language as a whole. This will not be a language with several ways to do the same thing. I think Go really made strides here in showing the value of simplicity. The benefit of this is we will not be looking to constantly add the newest thing in programming language theory, but want to keep the language small, simple, and focused.

That said, we are not making a language for complete novices either (unlike Go). This must be a very expressive and productive language with few features, but that compose well together. To that end, it will have a semi-functional feel to it (more below) but ultimately be imperative. Picking up a new language in one or two days is great, but if you are immediately suffering due to lack of compositiion or expressiveness, you won't be as productive longer term.

`Goal`: Imagine Go being on the far left and a language like Rust on the far right. We are aiming somewhat left of center. Considerably less complex than Rust, but solidly more capable than Go.
